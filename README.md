Welcome to my Jeopardy game! This project is a fun way to test your trivia knowledge across five exciting categories. One of those categories is about me!

**Project Overview******

**This Jeopardy game features:**

Five Categories: Test your knowledge in a variety of subjects (including me lol).
Scoreboard: Keep track of your points and see who's wins the game among your friends.
Responsive Design: Enjoy the game with a user-friendly interface.

**Tech Stack:**

Front End: Built with React, allowing for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
Back End: Developed in JavaScript to manage game logic and data storage.

This project was an initial test for me to dive into React and gain hands-on experience creating a full-stack web application. I learned about managing state, props, and how to connect the front end with the back end seamlessly.
